Sink deeply deeply
Never float again
Reflected in the hollow eyes
Brittle and weak yarn fixed by mending
Continue to be filled in the built landscape

I died and just stood up
The overflowing stains dye the clear aquarium crimson
Invited by the fascinating scent
God's angel swam gorgeously

Everything comes at a price.
By offering this sacrifice I'll
continue to live on without ever rotting.
I'll keep waiting for the day you finally come to me.

Weight pure blood
Blood connection
"Sincere love" that is never understood
No more frustration

When the buds blossom again
Swear eternal promise
Gorgeous eyes are hollow
Pick pure white with a smug caress

Dizzy revelation illusion
I am the same as my arrested freedom

Hideous yet beautiful
Holy night dripping fresh blood
The corrupt soul just wanders
God's not with me.

"You decided I'm a freak based solely on a moral standpoint
But even if you hurt me, if the world rejects,
loathes or mocks me,
no matter how much you torment me, I know I did no wrong. "
